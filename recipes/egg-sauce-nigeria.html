      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Egg sauce is a common breakfast in Nigeria. Usually paired with a carb
        source (e.g. yam, plantain, potatoes). It is similar to scrambled eggs
        but done with a variety of vegetables.

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Chop the garlic finely.</li>
        <li>
          Chop the tomatoes, peppers and onion. Or blend coarsely in a food
          processor - If you are doing this, blend the onion first and separate
          it from the other ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>Break the eggs and whisk with a pinch of salt, and keep aside.</li>
        <li>
          Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan, then add onions. Cook until
          the onions are soft and starting to go brown.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the garlic, curry powder and smoked paprika, stir for 1 min, then
          add the peppers and tomatoes. Mix the content of the pan well and
          leave to simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Check the sauce and occasionally stir until it is reduced. This should
          take at least 10 mins, by which time the oil would be separated from
          the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce the heat to very low and pour the egg in. Mix the egg into the
          sauce, then bring the heat back to medium.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continue to stir with a wooden spoon to cook the eggs evenly. Use the
          spoon to scrape the sides into the centre of the pan, as this tends to
          cook first. Do this until the eggs are cooked through and no longer
          runny.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from heat and serve.</li>
      </ol>
